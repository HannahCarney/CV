### Hannah Carney

Born in London, I started coding at the age of 7 on a website called Neopets. Through that site, I built a guild by teaching myself HTML 3.2 and photoshop. Eventually, I had over 1000+ active members, and even "employed" other members to help me manage them, and the best part was that no one knew I was so young. After moving to the U.S at age 11, the farm I lived on didn't have internet connection (I know right!), and I quickly moved into the arts out of pure boredom. I became a photorealist, studied Art History, and even had a brief stint as a tomb-raider. Eventually, I moved back to London and realized that my passion and love for code had never left.

| ------------- | ------------ |  ----------  |
|TurnUp is a playlist app where users log in with Spotify. A party planner will create their playlist name, which is automatically added to their spotify account. A link is then given to send to friends who pick a few songs for the party playlist. Using Beacon technology, the songs are only added to the playlist when the user arrives at the party. If the user leaves (with their phone of course) the songs are temporarily removed from the playlist. This way your songs will never play if you aren't in the room!

## Skills

### Can control thousands of drunk people

I started Farm Fest when I was 16. It was a 6 year running festival that eventually outgrew my parents' property (and patience). We made up to $40,000 a year in profit.

- General Manager and host of local music festival Farm Fest with 3000+ attendees
- Can sometimes control musicians, but it is much harder than drunk people
- [Interview with my business partner](http://www.citypaper.com/bcp-blog-3833-20110701,0,2651809.story)
- [Announced by pitchfork alongside barclaycard-wireless](http://pitchfork.com/news/46961-festivals-in-brief-barclaycard-wireless-trna-west-fest-farm-fest/)
- [Video made by an attendee](https://vimeo.com/58645020)

### Tomb-raider

I was part of a team that discovered the first known burial site within a Temple precinct in Egypt.

- [Read about the discovery here](http://krieger.jhu.edu/magazine/v10n1/unearthed/)
- Worked with magnetometer and Electrical Resistivity Tomography recorder to view underground areas
- Learned archeological photography as well as drawing pottery shards for publication
- In general, very willing to work outside of known comfort zones
- Looks fabulous as Indiana Jones (See above article for proof)


###  Photorealist

I went to the same art school as Tupac, who is still alive by the way, and studied Visual Arts. I developed a unique interest in capturing faces to their finite details. I further developed this skill as an adult.

- Basically really good at copying things
- [the proof](https://instagram.com/hannahlourealism/)
- Eventually I want to build my own website for my artistic endeavors

### 3D Designer

I scanned and rendered the lizards for the Darren Aronofsky film Noah. I also did the ice sculptures for the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. Alas, most of the time was spent reverse-engineering machine parts.
