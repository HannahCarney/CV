### Hannah Carney

Born in London, I started coding at the age of 7 on a website called Neopets. Through that site, I built a guild using HTML 3.2 with 1000+ active members, and even "employed" other members to help me manage them. No one knew I was so young. After moving to the U.S at age 11, I lost all internet conenction and quickly moved into the arts. I became a photorealist, studied Art History, and even had a brief stint as a tomb-raider. Eventually, I moved back to London and realized that my passion and love for code had never left. My ambition is to work with a close team developing new products, and preferably in a startup with decent funding.

## Skills

### Can control thousands of drunk people (Farm Fest)

I started Farm Fest when I was 16. It was a 6 year running festival that eventually outgrew my parents' property (and patience). We made up to $40,000 a year in profit.

- General Manager and host of local music festival Farm Fest with 3000+ attendees
- Can sometimes control musicians, but it is much harder than drunk people
- [Interview with my business partner](http://www.citypaper.com/bcp-blog-3833-20110701,0,2651809.story)
- [Announced by pitchfork alongside barclaycard-wireless](http://pitchfork.com/news/46961-festivals-in-brief-barclaycard-wireless-trna-west-fest-farm-fest/)
- [Video made by an attendee](https://vimeo.com/58645020)

### Curious, with a hunger for discovery

I was part of a team that discovered the first known burial site within a Temple precinct in Egypt.

- [Read about the discovery here](http://krieger.jhu.edu/magazine/v10n1/unearthed/)
- Worked with magnetometer and Electrical Resistivity Tomography recorder to view underground areas
- Learned archeological photography as well as drawing pottery shards for publication
- In general, very willing to work outside of known comfort zones
- Looks fabulous as Indiana Jones (See above article for proof)


###  Photorealist

I went to the same art school as Tupac, who is still alive by the way, and studied Visual Arts. I developed a unique interest in capturing faces to their finite details. I further developed this skill as an adult.

- Basically really good at copying things

- Eventually I want to build my own website for my artistic endeavors
